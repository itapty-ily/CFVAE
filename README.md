# CFVAEs
This is a Algorithm based on VAEs for classification with insufficient training samples

The source codes will be available after my submission.

We will revise VAEs as CFVAEs and embed CFVAEs in the deep network to solve the problem of deep learning with insufficient samples. 

# RELATIVE WORK 

Variational autocoders: https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models

Resnet: https://github.com/wenxinxu/resnet-in-tensorflow

# Our works

We will upload the souce codes about the CFVAEs with Resnet for CIFAR10 data set where we use 10,000 samples in the training batches for training and validation, and evalute the algorithm on test set.
